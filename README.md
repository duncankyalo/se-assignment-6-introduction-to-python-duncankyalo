Python Basics

What is Python, and why is it popular?
Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Its popularity stems from features like:

Readability: Python's syntax is clean and intuitive, similar to natural language, making it easy to learn.
Interpreted: Python runs code line by line, which speeds up development and testing since there's no need for compilation.
Dynamically Typed: It automatically infers data types, which allows for more flexible and concise code.
Extensive Libraries: With a wide range of libraries for tasks like data analysis, web development, and machine learning, Python is highly versatile.
Cross-platform Compatibility: It runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Python excels in:

Data Science & Machine Learning: Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow make it dominant in these fields.
Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask facilitate rapid web app creation.
Scripting & Automation: Python is great for automating tasks and data processing.
Game Development: Libraries like Pygame are perfect for creating games.
DevOps & Infrastructure Management: Its automation capabilities are widely used in these areas.
Installing Python
Windows:

Download the latest Python installer from the official website.
Run the installer and select "Add Python to PATH."
Verify the installation by opening a command prompt and typing python --version.
macOS:

Download the installer from the official website.
Run the installer.
Open Terminal and type python3 --version to verify.
Linux:

Use your package manager. For Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get update followed by sudo apt-get install python3.
Open a terminal and type python3 --version to verify.
Setting up a Virtual Environment:

Virtual environments isolate projects and dependencies.
Create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv myenv (replace myenv with your environment name).
Activate the environment:
Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate
Install packages: Use pip install <package_name>.
Deactivate: Use deactivate.
Python Syntax and Semantics
A simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!":

python
Copy code
print("Hello, World!")
print() is a function that outputs text to the console.
"Hello, World!" is a string.
The parentheses contain the argument to be printed.
Data Types and Variables
Python's basic data types:

Integer (int): Whole numbers, e.g., 10, -5.
Float (float): Decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14, -2.5.
String (str): Characters, e.g., "Hello".
Boolean (bool): True or False.
None: Represents no value.
python
Copy code
# Integer
age = 25
print(age)

# Float
price = 19.99
print(price)

# String
name = "Alice"
print(name)

# Boolean
is_active = True
print(is_active)

# None
value = None
print(value)
Control Structures
Conditional Statements:

These execute code based on conditions.

python
Copy code
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Excellent!")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Good job!")
else:
    print("Keep practicing!")
Loops:

Repeat blocks of code.

python
Copy code
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Iteration:", count)
    count += 1
Functions in Python
Functions are reusable code blocks that perform tasks, promoting organization and reusability.

python
Copy code
def sum_of_two(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

result = sum_of_two(5, 10)
print("Sum:", result)  # Output: Sum: 15
Lists and Dictionaries
Lists: Ordered collections of items.
Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
python
Copy code
# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)

# Adding an element
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)

# Accessing elements
print(numbers[0])

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print(person)

# Accessing values
print(person["name"])

# Updating values
person["city"] = "Los Angeles"
print(person)
Exception Handling
Exception handling manages errors during execution.

python
Copy code
try:
    num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    num2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))
    result = num1 / num2
    print("Result:", result)

except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!")

except ValueError:
    print("Error: Please enter valid numbers!")

finally:
    print("This block always executes.")
Modules and Packages
Modules: Files with Python code.
Packages: Collections of modules.
To use a module:

python
Copy code
import math

print(math.sqrt(25))  # Output: 5.0
print(math.pi)        # Output: 3.141592653589793
File I/O
Reading from a file:

python
Copy code
with open("my_file.txt", "r") as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print(contents)
Writing to a file:

python
Copy code
my_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    for item in my_list:
        file.write(item + "\n")

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
